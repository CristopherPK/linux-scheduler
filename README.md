# Linux Scheduler

This repo contains project 3 from Operating Systems class (UNLV CS 370 Fall 2015). 

======

### Description: 

The purpose of this project is to provide insight into the Linux Process Scheduling Algorithm presented in class by simulating a simplified version of the CPU scheduler. The Linux Process Scheduler divides CPU time into epochs. In a single epoch, every process has a specified time slice. In a single epoch, the CPUâ€™s job is to schedule contending processes to use the CPU in a fair and efficient manner.
